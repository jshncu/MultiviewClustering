# MultiviewClustering
#### Introduction
This package includes the proposed multi-view data clustering methods. The codes shared in this repository implement the algorithms for the models proposed in the following papers. Welcome to use our models as the comparison methods in your papers. If you have any questions, you are welcome to send an email to me (jianshengwu@ncu.edu.cn).

#### 软件架构
1、Method 1：ADA-NMF
 Running the matlab script "MSRC_Demos.m" in the folder "ADA-NMF" will yield the clustering partition of the dataset MSRC_v1.
